-> This version of the project has object-oriented programming. The Main file contains the loading and parsing of main XML files.
-> The other file with the name ‘xml_to_csv.py’ was developed with two classes. The first class is named a ‘FolderMaker,’ which is utilized for creating new folders while downloading zip files for storing and unzipping the information of the XML files.
-> For parsing the XML files, the “xmltodict” python module was utilized, which converts the XML information and stores it into dictionary-type data.
-> From this dictionary data type, identify and locate the DLTINS zip files, download files using the wget package, store them in the new folder, and unzip all files into a new folder.
-> Next part into the main.py, the extracted zip file XML is loaded into the program and parsed the XML file into dictionary type.
-> At the back end of the program ‘xml_to_csv.py file, the class name ‘XmlConverter’ contains two functions. The first function locates and identifies the dictionary keys and values for the attributes needed to store in a data frame as per the requirement of column attributes using pandas.
-> All information from 4 XML files is further stored into CSV files and initially stored locally and stored into the s3 bucket by keys and secret keys of the AWS.
